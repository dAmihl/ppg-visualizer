# ppg-visualizer



Very quick&simple visualizing tool rendering a graph generated by [ppg-yaml](https://github.com/dAmihl/ppg-yaml/) using a primitive YAML file as context.

The tool displays the generated graph and offers functionality to abstractly "play" the puzzle by invoking possible events.

* A green node means the node is completed
* Red means it is active and can be completed (i.e. can handle related events)
* White means incomplete / inactive. These nodes don't respond to events.

The text display helps in case the rendered graph is not enough (or not easily readable).

Uses GLFW & ImGui.
